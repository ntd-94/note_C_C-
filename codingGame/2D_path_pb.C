/*
You are in a 2D array world with R rows and C columns, where you live in the (0,0) coordinate and you need to find the number of paths to the heaven cell (Rth row and Cth column).

You always start from the top-left cell and try to reach the bottom-right cell.

You can move either to the right or down one cell at a time.

Cells marked as 0 can be moved to, while cells marked as 1 cannot be visited.

Note: There might be zero paths to the heaven cell sometimes.
Input
Line 1: Two space-separated integers R and C
Next R lines: C space-separated integers, being that each of those integers can only have the values 0 or 1
Output
The number of paths that you can reach the heaven cell.
Constraints
1 ≤ R, C ≤ 6
Example
Input
3 3
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
Output
2
